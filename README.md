## Original Idea

If you look towards the beginning of the commit messages on the GitHub repo, you'll see that the original messages contained information pertaining towards social media, particularly using the Facebook Graph and Twitter API. The original idea for project two was a social media integration app. A website where you could see your twitter feed, facebook feed, and maybe even include a news API.
